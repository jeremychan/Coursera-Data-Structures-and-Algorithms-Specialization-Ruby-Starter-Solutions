# Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization-Ruby-Starter-Solutions

This repository will include the Ruby starter solutions for the 
Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization specialization.

I could only share the starter solutions to aid learners who are 
wishing to use Ruby to do the assignments. Sharing the completed 
code is against the code of conduct of Coursera.

Courses in the specialization:
 
- Algorithmic Toolbox
- Data Structures
- Algorithms on Graphs
- Algorithms on Strings
- Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
